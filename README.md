Description:
For this project our team will develop a Student Assignment Portal where students will be able to view and access their assignments issued by their instructor. The application will be developed using modern web frameworks. This will require the development of a Representational state transfer (REST) Application Programming Interface (API), a constant integration, constant development (CICD) pipeline, and a persistence (Database) layer. The website should be deployed to a Platform as a Service (PaaS) such as Heroku or Google App Engine. 
This Repository will act as the Mobile Front-End of the project. The Mobile Application will use a Room Database that backs up into the Web Database. The Application will use Retrifit to access the API.
